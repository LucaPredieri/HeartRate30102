# Heart Rate with the MAXIM 30102 sensor.
  Measuring heart rate with the MAX30102, using the SpO2 configuration. The MAX30205 is a nice sensor made by MAXIM INTEGRATED and it is really useful and fun. In this simple project, I used it to measure the heartbeat, throught the SpO2 configuration, with 400 Sa/s, every 8 samples they are averaged so we have 50 Sa/s. The rate is processed and the output is visible on the monitor.
